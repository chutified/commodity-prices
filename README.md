USAGE >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

GetCommodity:

    CommodityRequest
    ```json
    {
        Name: "nickel";
    }
    ```
    CC: enter the name of the commodity, supported commodities are: ...

    CommodityResponse
    ```json
    {
        "Name": "nickel",
        "Price": 13512,
        "Currency": "USD",
        "WeightUnit": "ton",
        "ChangeP": -0.24,
        "ChangeN": -33,
        "LastUpdate": "1594771200"
    }
    ```
    CC: the response holds the name which was entered in the request, current price of the commodity on the market per weight unit, the last changes in percentages and a number, and the unix time of the last update.

SubscribeCommodity

    Works similarly as the GetCommodity call. It receivs the stream of CommodityRequests, but does not react instantly (for that there is a GetCommodity service). Service register request as a subscribtion and whenever the data of the source gets update, it automatically sends every subscribed commodities responses to each client.

    For example:

        Client_1 subscribed for: "gold", "silver", "platinum"
        Client_2 subscribed for: "milk", "rice", "corn"

    >>> DATA get updates

        Client_1 receivs responses for: "gold", "silver", "platinum"
        Client_2 receivs responses for: "milk", "rice", "corn"

EXAMPLES >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

For these examples the grpcurl tool is used to generate binary calls to gRPC servers.
The real use of gRPC client can be found here.

GetCommodity responses on the CommodityRequests, which has one field Name.
```bash
[tommychu@localhost commodity-prices]$ grpcurl --plaintext -d '{"Name":"uranium"}' 127.0.0.1:10501 Commodity.GetCommodity
{
    "Name": "uranium",
    "Price": 32.95,
    "WeightUnit": "250 pfund u308",
    "LastUpdate": "1594339200"
}

[tommychu@localhost commodity-prices]$ grpcurl --plaintext -d '{"Name":"rbob gasoline"}' 127.0.0.1:10501 Commodity.GetCommodity
{
    "Name": "rbob gasoline",
    "Price": 1.23,
    "WeightUnit": "gallone",
    "ChangeP": -0.2,
    "LastUpdate": "1594950240"
}
```
```bash
[COMMODITY SERVICE] 2020/07/17 06:12:35 [SUCCESS] Listening on 127.0.0.1:10501
[COMMODITY SERVICE] 2020/07/17 06:12:55 [SUCCESS] respond to the client's GetCommodity request: uranium
[COMMODITY SERVICE] 2020/07/17 06:13:55 [SUCCESS] respond to the client's GetCommodity request: rbob gasoline
```

SubscribeCommodity will start subscribing a specific commodity for the client.
Notice that the reaction of the request is not instant (fr that there is a GetCommodity call).
```bash
{"Name":"feeder cattle"}
{"Name":"lean hog"}
```
```bash
[COMMODITY SERVICE] 2020/07/17 06:21:17 [SUCCESS] Listening on 127.0.0.1:10501
[COMMODITY SERVICE] 2020/07/17 06:21:50 [SUCCESS] client subscribed: Name:"feeder cattle"
[COMMODITY SERVICE] 2020/07/17 06:22:17 [SUCCESS] client subscribed: Name:"lean hog"
```
When the source gets an update.
```bash
[COMMODITY SERVICE] 2020/07/17 06:22:32 [UPDATE] send new values to subscribers
```
```json
{
    "commodityResponse": {
        "Name": "feeder cattle",
        "Price": 1.35,
        "Currency": "USc",
        "WeightUnit": "lb.",
        "ChangeP": -0.72,
        "ChangeN": -0.01,
        "LastUpdate": "1590710400"
    }
}
{
    "commodityResponse": {
        "Name": "lean hog",
        "Price": 0.54,
        "Currency": "USD",
        "WeightUnit": "lb.",
        "ChangeP": 13.42,
        "ChangeN": 0.06,
        "LastUpdate": "1594857600"
    }
}

```
